# Traffic-Signal-Recognition
I had done Traffic sign recongnition project which uses Convolution neural network that can easily classify the images.
Technologies used:
1)For image recognition I used Deep learning techniques in that
  1)Used Tensorflow framework
  2)CNN model
2)For importing images and displaying the result I used html, css, javascript for frontend.
